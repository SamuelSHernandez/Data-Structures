# CPTR242 Student Repository

## Projects Directory

This directory contains three subdirectories, one for each project in the course.
As each project is assigned, the subdirectories will appear in your course directory and you can begin modifying the files to make progress on your project.
Be sure that you save and push your changes once you've completed the assignment so that your most recent version is graded.
