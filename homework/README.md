## Homework Directory

This directory contains ten subdirectories, one for each homework assignment in the course.
As each homework is assigned, the subdirectories will appear in your course directory and you can begin modifying the files to make progress on your assignment.
Be sure that you save and push your changes once you've completed the assignment so that your most recent version is graded.
